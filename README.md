# Fara AI Assistant 
Fully Autonomous Remote Artificial Intellignece

**Fara AI Assistant** is a local AI assistant that runs entirely on your computer. It uses **Ollama** as the language model backend, with a **FastAPI backend** and a **simple browser-based frontend** for chat interaction. The assistant is designed for experimentation and learning, with possible future features like **voice input/output** and **visual avatars**.

## **Features**

- Local AI assistant — no cloud required
- FastAPI backend for API communication
- Browser-based frontend with chat interface
- Spinner and elapsed time for responses
- Short-term memory for conversation history
- Works with **Ollama CLI** (`phi3:mini` model)
- Designed to be easily portable and open-source

## **Requirements**

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Ollama installed and models pulled**  
  - Install Ollama: [https://ollama.com](https://ollama.com)  
  - Pull the model:  
    ```bash
    ollama pull phi3:mini
    ```
- Pip packages: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `requests`

---

## **Setup & Installation**

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/RJSlabbert/fara-ai.git
cd fara-ai

2. Install Python dependencies:

  pip install fastapi uvicorn requests

3. Start Ollama:

  ollama serve

Keep this terminal open. Do not try to run Ollama from the script or exe.

Running the Assistant

1. Run the main script:

python run_app.py

2. The script will automatically:
  Start the backend server
  Start the frontend server
  Open your default browser at http://localhost:5500

Start chatting in the browser interface. Responses will be generated by the phi3:mini Ollama model via CLI.

Future Improvements

Voice input and output for the assistant

Visual avatar integration

Better conversation memory storage

Packaging as a fully working one-click executable
